              I am a data scientist and full-stack engineer working at <a

                ApexRMS. I am also an Adjunct Faculty at Western University in

                Biology Department
              </a>. I enjoy finding new data sources or approaches to improve
              our ability to manage and conserve biodiversity. My experience is
              in extreme value theory, machine learning, linear mixed modelling,
              predictive modelling, and multidimensional analyses.

              Previously, I have worked at the <a
                href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/cue/welcome"
              >
                Center for Urban Environments</a
              >
              in partnership with local conservation authorities. There I explored
              how urban biodiversity is impacted by land development and climate
              change. I have also worked as a data scientist at <a
                href="http://www.yorku.ca/index.html"
              >
                York University
              </a> exploring the effects of climate variation on lake ice and water
              quality. I completed a Killam post-doctoral fellowship in 2020 at <a
                href="https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html"
              >
                University of Alberta
              </a> examining the effects climate change on alpine butterflies and
              domestic grazing on native biodiversity. I received both my PhD (2018)
              and BSc (2012) at York University testing how desert plants respond
              to extreme climates.

              I have worked as a research coordinator with the <a
                href="https://climateconnections.ca/"
              >
                Ontario Climate Consortium (OCC)

                The Nature Conservancy (TNC)
              </a>. At the OCC I collaborated with local municipalities to
              develop an adaptation plan to climate change. My time with the TNC
              I provided recommendations for the strategic retirement of
              agricultural land to preserve endangered species in California.

              Most of my research analysis and workshop resources can be found
              at <a href="https://github.com/afilazzola"> my GitHub page</a>. If
              you are working on a project that could benefit from my expertise,
              especially anything with habitat suitability modelling, land cover
              classification of aerial images, or anonymized human movement
              data, please reach out to me to discuss more!
