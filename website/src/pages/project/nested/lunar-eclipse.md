Decision makers need access to spatial models, especially those that predict changes in the future. Delivering those models to decision makers in a way that is accessible is a major barrier to implementation. [Syncrosim](https://syncrosim.com/) is a desktop software designed to streamline the process of delivering map-based forecasting models to users without the requirement of being a data scientist or having extensive computing expertise. However, desktop application are still are limiting, often requiring install permissions and upkeep for IT services.

I am currently working with the team at [ApexRMS](https://apexrms.com/) to design a web based version of Syncrosim. The web based application will allow users to upload spatial data and run different forecasting models without the need to understand parallel and cloud computing or requiring high-performance computing resources. We are currently in beta, but once released the app will be available to anyone interested in conducting spatial forecasting.

We built the app using React and NodeJS on AWS.
